# Menu Function - C Code Documentation

## Introduction

This C code defines a menu function that allows the user to select different options from a menu. Each option is associated with a unique integer value, and the user's choice is returned by the function.

## Function Description

### 1. `menu()`

- This function represents a menu for selecting different options.
- It clears the console screen using the `system("cls")` command to present a clear menu each time.
- The user is presented with a list of options, and they can enter the corresponding integer value to select an option.
- The function reads the user's choice using the `scanf` function and stores it in the variable `ind`.
- Based on the user's input, the function checks the value of `ind` and returns the corresponding option as an integer. If an invalid input is provided, the function calls itself recursively to display the menu again until a valid choice is made.

## Usage

1. Call the `menu()` function in your C program to display the menu and obtain the user's choice.
2. The user should enter the integer value corresponding to the desired option.
3. The function will return the selected option as an integer, which can be used to determine the subsequent action in your program.

## Note

- The code assumes that the user will input valid integer values for selecting options from the menu.
- The code uses the `%d` format specifier to read integers from user input. Make sure to enter valid integer values; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur.
- The code clears the console screen using the `system("cls")` command, which may not be platform-independent. If portability is a concern, consider using alternative methods for clearing the console.
