# Divisible by 11 - C Code Documentation

## Introduction

This C code determines and prints all the numbers that are divisible by 11 within a given range (inclusive).

## Function Description

### 1. `div_11()`

- This function represents a program to find and print numbers divisible by 11 within a given range.
- It declares integer variables `divsr`, `inc`, `fin`, `i`, and an array `div[50]` to store the numbers divisible by 11.
- The user is prompted to enter the starting number (`inc`) and the ending number (`fin`) of the range.
- The function then iterates through the range of numbers from `inc` to `fin`, inclusive.
- If a number is divisible by 11 (i.e., its remainder when divided by 11 is 0), it is added to the `div` array.
- After processing all numbers within the range, the function prints the numbers stored in the `div` array, which are the numbers divisible by 11.

## Example Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Function declaration
int div_11();

int main()
{
    div_11(); // Call the function to find numbers divisible by 11
    return 0;
}
```

## Note

- The code provided is intended to be part of a larger program. To use it as a stand-alone program, you should add the `main()` function, as shown in the example usage.
- Please ensure that you include the necessary header files and any other required functions to make the program functional.
- There are a few issues in the provided code that need to be fixed:
  1. The `div` array should be defined outside the loop, before its first use.
  2. Initialize `i` to 0 before using it in the loop.
  3. Change `int(num)` to `int num` in the loop header.
  4. Instead of printing `div[i]`, use a loop to print all the elements stored in the `div` array.
  5. Ensure that the number `inc` is less than or equal to `fin` to avoid an infinite loop. If the user enters a larger value for `inc`, the loop will never exit, and the program will become unresponsive.
